# StateShot
ðŸ’¾ Non-aggressive history state management with structure sharing.

> Just push your states into StateShot and `undo` / `redo` them!


## Getting Started

Install via NPM:

```bash
npm i stateshot
```

Basic usage:

```js
import { History } from 'stateshot'

const state = { a: 1, b: 2 }

const history = new History()
history.pushSync(state) // the terser `history.push` API is async

state.a = 2 // mutation!
history.pushSync(state)

history.get() // { a: 2, b: 2 }
history.undo().get() // { a: 1, b: 2 }
history.redo().get() // { a: 2, b: 2 }
```


## API

### `History`
`new History(options?: Options)`

Main class for state management, supported options:

* `rules` - Optional rules array for optimizing data transforming.
* `wait` - Debounce time for `push` in milliseconds, `50` by default.
* `maxLength` - Max length saving history states, `100` by default.

#### `push`
`(state: State, pickIndex?: Number) => Promise<History>`

Push state data in history, using `pushSync` under the hood. `state` doesn't have to be JSON serializable since you can define rules to parse it.

If `pickIndex` is specified, only this index of state's child will be serialized. Other children will be copied from previous record. This optimization only happens if previous records exists.

#### `pushSync`
`(state: State, pickIndex?: Number) => History`

Push state into history stack immediately. `pickIndex` also supported.

#### `undo`
`() => History`

Undo a record if possible, supports chaining, e.g., `undo().undo().get()`.

#### `redo`
`() => History`

Redo a record if possible, also supports chaining,

#### `hasUndo`
`Boolean`

Whether current state has undo records before.

#### `hasRedo`
`Boolean`

Whether current state has redo records after.

#### `get`
`() => State`

Pull out a history state from records.

#### `reset`
`() => History`

Clear internal data structure.


### `Rule`
`{ match: Function, toRecord: Function, fromRecord: Function }`

By defining rules you can specify how to transform between states and internal "chunks". Chunks are used for structure sharing.

> Rules are only designed for optimization. You don't have to learn or use them unless you've encountered performance bottleneck.

#### `match`
`node: StateNode => Boolean`

Defines whether a rule can be matched. For example, if you're saving a vDOM state with different `type` field, just define some rules like `node => node.type === 'image'` or `node => node.type === 'text'`.

#### `toRecord`
`StateNode => { chunks: Chunks, children: Children }`

For matched node, `chunks` is the serializable data we transform it into, and `children` picks out its children for further traversing (By default we traverse the `children` field in each state node). Usually one chunk is enough, but you can split a node into multi chunks in this manner:

```js
// Suppose `image` is a heavy field, we can split it into a standalone chunk.
const state = {
  type: 'container',
  children: [
    { type: 'image', left: 100, top: 100, image: 'foo' },
    { type: 'image', left: 200, top: 200, image: 'bar' },
    { type: 'image', left: 300, top: 300, image: 'baz' }
  ]
}

const toRecord = node => ({
  chunks: [
    { ...node, image: undefined },
    node.image
  ],
  children: null // no children since image node is leaf node.
})
```

#### `fromRecord`
`{ chunks: Chunks, children: Children } => StateNode`

Parse the chunks back into the state node. For case before:

```js
const fromRecord = ({ chunks, children }) => ({
  ...chunks[0],
  image: chunks[1]
})

const rule = {
  match: ({ type }) => type === 'image',
  toRecord,
  fromRecord
}
```
